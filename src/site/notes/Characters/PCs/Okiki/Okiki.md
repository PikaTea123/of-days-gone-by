## **Backstory:**
---
- Servant to [[Characters/The Pantheon/Nagaiame\|Nagaiame]], guard of his domain
- Nagaiame, to defeat the Inkscourges, trapped them inside his cave to prevent them from rampaging across the lands
- With Nagaiame slain by the Inkscourges, the servants no longer had a purpose
- One by one, they left the colony, trying to figure out how to escape the Inkscourges
- The only thing protecting them was the magic imbued in Nagaiame's corpse
- As they tried various light based methods, they were each wiped out except for Okiki
- Okiki had such devotion to his god that he stuck around until there was no one left
- When he did leave, he fashioned one of Nagaiame's teeth into a weapon and used it to fight against the Inkscourges
- While they did begin to overwhelm him after a while of fighting and running, calcifying the parts of his body they touched, but the lost spirits of his brethren shaped themselves into ghostly flesh to keep him going
- Eventually, he was able to break his way out of the cave and reseal it
- Now, he's trying to find a way to revive Nagaiame, hiding his calcified body parts using the spirits and also using them as his echo
- To revive Nagaiame, according to ancient legend, needs a tooth, a scale, and some blood from Nagaiame
	- Tooth obtained
	- Chasing after [[Characters/PCs/Cortège/Cortège\|Cortège]] to get scales
	- Have to get the blood from [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ksekamt\|Ksekamt]], who because of ideological differences with Nagaiame, often fought with him

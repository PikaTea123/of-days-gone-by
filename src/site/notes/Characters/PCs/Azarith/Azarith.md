## **Backstory:**
---
>Azarith is the son of [[Characters/PCs/Ixila & Basset/Ixila & Basset\|Ixila & Basset]], a member of the [[Factions/Waxing Crescent Guild\|Waxing Crescent Guild]] that specializes in making candles and candlesticks, although Azarith never got to know his birth parents. When Azarith was about 2, he rode with Ixila on a merchant caravan heading north to the town of [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Wydell\|Wydell]], where the guild planned to set up shop. During this trip, the caravan was caught in a massive snowstorm that ended up separating Azarith from the rest of the group. Alone in the frigid wilderness, Azarith’s death would have been almost assured if he wasn’t found and taken in by [[Characters/Side Characters/Ei Aivan\|Ei Aivan]], former member of the [[Factions/Order of the Arbour\|Order of the Arbour]] and master illusionist. At her cabin in the woods, he would study under her mentorship for the next 14 years to learn illusion magic. While he has few memories from his earlier years, he does remember the cabin being broken into when he was 5 by [[Characters/PCs/Dr. Will Erneut/Dr. Will Erneut\|Dr. Will Erneut]]. Despite him not noticing anything actually having been stolen, Ei seemed quite worried, because, unbeknownst to him, Dr. Erneut had stolen the [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Dunes of Ksekamt\|Dunes of Ksekamt]], the artifact bestowed to Ei from [[Characters/The Pantheon/Nagaiame\|Nagaiame]].
>
>Over the next 9 years, Azarith and Ei got along well enough, although both of them had trouble expressing emotions and very apathetic personalities. Still, they cared about each other, and when Ei passed away due to old age when Azarith was 16, Azarith took it quite hard. More so than ever before, he felt empty. The next few years he spent simply surviving and practicing his illusion magic, always shivering no matter how many layers he had on, passing his days contentedly in the small, dingy cabin. However, it all changed the day [[Characters/PCs/Kemuri Ato/Kemuri Ato\|Kemuri Ato]] arrived in Wydell to perform a fireworks display for their citizens. Pressed up against the window of the cabin, Azarith watched in awe as the night sky was painted with a vivid mosaic of falling lights, colour bathing the forest below, and for the first time since Ei died, Azarith cried. For the first time since he was taken in, he stopped shivering. For the first time in his entire life, he had a dream of his own to chase.
>
>For someone like Azarith, the fireworks lasted much too little time to fully sate him, and so, he began trying to emulate the display via his own magic. However, having been trained in illusion magic his whole life, he could never create anything that matched the level of warmth the fireworks had given him, only ever being able to make tricks of the light. Perhaps to the untrained eye, they'd suffice, but Azarith could see each and every flicker and distortion and imperfection in the way it shined. His shivering grew worse, unable to be quelled even by the fire, and after a year of futilely shaping illusions, he decided to shift his focus. Heading into town for the first time since Ei was still alive, he searched for information on the person who performed the fireworks display and headed off on a journey to find her. Now, he and Kemuri travel together, and wherever they go, Azarith is on the lookout for any fire spells he can add to his spellbook.

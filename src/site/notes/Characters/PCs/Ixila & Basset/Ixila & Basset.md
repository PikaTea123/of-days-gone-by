## **Backstory:**
---
- Ixila is the older sister, Basset is the younger brother
- Were poor in their youth, with both of the siblings having to watch out for each other as they grew up on the streets
- Created a code using various tapped rhythms (basically their own version of morse code) to communicate danger and secret messages to better navigate the hostile underbelly of [[Locations/Tharin/Muejiza/Muejiza\|Muejiza]]
- Ixila was always more forwards focused, concentrating on the future they wanted to have
- Basset felt their situation was unfair and that neither Ixila nor him should've had to suffer like they did
- They managed to claw their way into the [[Factions/Waxing Crescent Guild\|Waxing Crescent Guild]] and find themselves a decent living
- Disagree on what should follow death
- Ixila believes remembrance is for the purpose of bringing peace to the dead and the bereaved
	- Nothing lasts forever, and likewise for people
	- Both the living and the dead would do good to move on
	- Became a candle and candlestick maker to bring respite to the dead; follows the dogmas of [[Characters/The Pantheon/Caddh\|Caddh]]
	- Travelled around the continent selling candles and teaching people how to properly perform the lighting ceremonies for the dead
	- Fell in love with a man on her travels and had a son with him, although she had to leave soon after giving birth to continue her merchant travelling
	- Her and her partner still write letters to each other, although it takes a while for Ixila to respond since she's always on the move
	- Took in [[Characters/PCs/Whisp/Whisp\|Whisp]] during a trip up to [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Wydell\|Wydell]] at [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Nyphit Temple\|Nyphit Temple]], the same trip where she lost [[Characters/PCs/Azarith/Azarith\|Azarith]] during the storm
	- During her period of mourning for Azarith (although that was not the name she gave him), she learned how important her kind of solace, candle-lighting, could be to herself, and extrapolating, to people in general
	- Believes injustice and unfairness is a simple fact of life--one which we cannot change and which focusing too much on robs us of any possibility of enjoying what we do have
	- She continued to travel with Whisp for a few more months, but after nearly dying to an explosion in the [[Locations/Tharin/Vantegramen\|Vantegramen]]-Wydell warzones which took her vision and scorched Whisp's wings, she quickly realized this wasn't safe for a child and settled down in a small house just beyond the outskirts of the warzone where her workers could easily dip in and out to resupply without putting Whisp in danger
	- Despite the loss of her vision, she became more motivated to rise through the ranks of the Waxing Crescent Guild in order to better provide for Whisp 
- Basset believes remembrance is to honor and immortalize the memory of the dead
	- Nothing should be lost forever, and remembrance is how we extend life past what the gods want for us
	- If we must die, we can at least delay oblivion
	- Became a scribe and historian to bring glory to the dead; follows the dogmas of [[Characters/The Pantheon/Iwakami\|Iwakami]]
	- Founded the [[Factions/Malt and Pearson Co.\|Malt and Pearson Co.]] in order to discover the secrets of resurrection; wants to only use it for those taken well before their time
	- Believes people should at least be given the chance to secure their legacy; hates injustice and unfairness; "why should luck be the determiner in whether your life gets to have meaning?"
	- Travelled around to sites of mass death and destruction such as the [[Factions/Kànláng\|Kànláng]] and [[Factions/Vek'nai\|Vek'nai]] massacres and captured ghosts that lingered in the area due to feelings of unfinished business
	- Due to [[Characters/PCs/Conan Dubhan & Beo/Conan Dubhan & Beo\|Beo]]'s desertion of the [[Characters/The Pantheon/Vidatur#The Lunar Courts\|Lunar Courts]], the Hunter's Court has been in slight disarray as the Lunar Courts try to deal with an unprecedented loss of a major role within the hierarchy
	- This created enough of a gap between the actual deaths and the Hunter's Court coming to collect the particularly stubborn souls (a shocking number of the deaths in the massacres) for Basset to come in and seal the souls in special scrolls with incantations inscribed on them in [[Magic Items/Remet Ink and Paper\|Remet Ink]], a special ink that is able to manipulate souls but is insanely expensive due to the extensive distillation process it takes to make it
	- In this way, he believes he can keep the souls complete as he tries to discover the secrets to resurrection (although each soul requires an exorbitant amount of Remet Ink and Remet Paper to keep contained)
- Both were in the Waxing Crescent Guild; decided to make a bet to see who could climb higher in the ranks of the guild; the winner would then be crowned as having the "correct" ideology, although this was mainly for fun, and they both still respected the other as being entitled to their own opinions
- As much as Ixila disagrees with her brother, she taught Whisp both sides so he could make his own decision
- Once she learned about Basset holding wayward souls in scrolls, she felt this was actually invasive and harmful, so she marched over to Basset's office to confront him
- Basset was working on a way to transfer souls into an artificial body, but he unfortunately did not understand that not everything organism-shaped is capable of housing souls; there are specific metaphysical properties that a thing must have for a human soul to be able to inhabit it
- Feeling confident but unable to bring himself to use another person's soul to test it in case it didn't work, he decided to use himself as the test subject
- The spell he formulated, unable to transfer his soul to the artificial unusable body, instead transferred his soul directly to the nearby leftover Remet ink and paper
- When Ixila entered Basset's office, Basset communicates to her in their code 
- For all other intents and purposes, Basset's spell did work, allowing him to control his new form as a flurry of loose papers and ink held together with the spell and his soul
- Now Basset acts as Ixila's eyes while she travels to find a way to reverse this, also giving Ixila a chance to spread her lessons of candle-lighting now that she is able to traverse more dangerous areas
- Since Whisp is now off into the world, Ixila feels the need to continue spreading Caddh's dogma to keep the tradition alive
- Though they have vastly different ideologies, they still hold great respect for each other and love each other very much (albeit filled with a large amount of teasing and ribbing)
- They use the combined Grave domain from their respective gods, where their healing/support abilities are given by Caddh and their more offensive abilities are provided by Iwakami
- Due to the fragility of Basset's new form, he is required to stay near Ixila at all times to prevent any accidents and so that she can mend his form in case something happens

## **Backstory:**
---
- Daughter of [[Characters/PCs/Dr. Will Erneut/Dr. Will Erneut\|Will Erneut]] and [[Characters/Side Characters/Ikka Meryls Erneut\|Ikka Meryls Erneut]]
- Never got to know mother due to her dying in childbirth
- Lives a fairly well-off life for a while
- At 5-years-old, meets a 9-year-old [[Characters/PCs/Kemuri Ato/Kemuri Ato\|Kemuri Ato]] at a playground in [[Locations/Tharin/Muejiza/Muejiza\|Muejiza]]; gets her address for a playdate 
- Just a few days later, Petla is age reversed for the first time by Dr. Erneut with the [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Dunes of Ksekamt\|Dunes of Ksekamt]]
- For the next two years, Petla is reversed 13 times, the longest streak lasting 5 months and the shortest streak lasting just 3 hours
- Despite her age reversing, her consciousness does not reverse, although she fears her father's violation of her autonomy so much that she hides that fact from him in case he goes further
- Instead, each time she reverses, her consciousness splits and develops separately
- Eventually, on her final reverse, she makes it to 9 years old, and reaches an age where she feels she can survive on her own
- She sneaks into his laboratory and shatters the Dunes of Ksekamt before grabbing an ancient axe artifact and running away
- The magic inside the Dunes of Ksekamt imbued her with [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ksekamt\|Ksekamt]]'s blessing of vitality once it shattered
- Her barbarian rage is actually the result of her mind fracturing momentarily from all the screaming of her other consciousnesses trying to guide her out of danger
- She heads to the address she remembered from her friend 2 years ago, not knowing who else to turn to, leading her to a small village a moderate distance south of Muejiza
- When she arrives, she finds the village utterly devastated, only a few buildings remaining and vacant lots of coarse dirt where buildings definitely once were
- In the ashes of the address she received, under the remains of a burnt bed, she finds a box with a letter addressed to Kemuri Ato, written in the last moments of her friends and family
- Unsure of where to go now, she follows the ashen gravel path that remains from the village, finding herself standing at the door to an ancient labyrinth
- Deciding to unseal it on a whim, she's terrified to encounter a hulking minotaur, [[Characters/PCs/Nímaváros/Nímaváros\|Nímaváros]]
- Nímaváros is actually quite kind, takes Petla along with her and vows to bring her to Kemuri Ato
- Petla is now determined to deliver the letter to Kemuri while remaining hidden from her father, also helping Nímaváros in combat whenever she can

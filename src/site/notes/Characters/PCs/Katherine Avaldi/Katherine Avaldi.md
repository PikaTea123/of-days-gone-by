## **Backstory:**
---
- Born to [[Characters/Side Characters/Selica Avaldi\|Selica Avaldi]], raised by [[Characters/PCs/Naochi Avaldi/Naochi Avaldi\|Naochi Avaldi]]
- Growing up, Naochi always told her that she must present herself beautifully so she could marry into higher standing/a comfortable lifestyle
- Katherine, despite being only a teenager in elven eyes (early 30s), desperately tried to meet this expectation
- Hears rumours of a [[Magic Items/The Pralucerna\|The Pralucerna]] held in the [[Locations/Tharin/Vantegramen\|Vantegramen]] treasury that would grant [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ryst\|Ryst]]'s blessing of beauty to anyone who drank from it
- Ran away from home to chase this rumour
- After some carousing for information, she joined the [[Factions/Waxing Crescent Guild\|Waxing Crescent Guild]], which had recently gained a lot of favour with Vantegramen via their sponsorship during the war, allowing her access to a guild-run auction of some of the artifacts in the Vantegramen treasury, although none of the artifacts offered were what she was after
- Using techniques Naochi taught her to keep Katherine safe in case someone came for them, Katherine was able to infiltrate the treasury
- Due to her never actually having seen the teapot before, which was made of a dull metal and oddly shaped, she instead took the ornate porcelain [[Magic Items/The Moll's Repast\|The Moll's Repast]] which looked very similar to a teapot
- This magic lamp was created by [[Characters/The Pantheon/Scaenatio\|Scaenatio]], containing a genie, mentally broken for the sake of Scaenatio's psychotic theatricality
- Katherine, thinking this was what she had set off after, asked the genie to grant her Ryst's blessing of beauty, and the genie, conditioned to cruelty, made her into a porcelain doll as beautiful as Ryst's own creations
- She lives as a hollow-eyed porcelain statue, face only able to change expression if no one is perceiving it, although the mechanism behind her ability to speak, see, or change expressions when not perceived is unknown
- At first, she was horrified at her transformation, doubly so since she had agreed to make a pact with the genie for it, and she headed back to the guild in shame
- Still, the members of the guild were very sympathetic despite her transformation and allowed her to continue working her craft: pottery
- She grew an affinity for painting her works, as well as painting herself, and she carries a fan to cover her face to give her the opportunity to change her expressions
- Now that she's in a healthier, less sheltered environment, she realizes both the sacrifices her grandmother made and just how messed up their situation was
- Now she's questioning whether to forgive Naochi or not and whether to go back
- In the meantime, she's decided to become a phantom thief, adding artifacts to her collection from the rich while scouring the underbelly of Vantegramen for intel for her patron's first mission: to break him free from his millennia of imprisonment as a genie
- Only, Scaenatio thought that this mission could do with a few more tribulations, and the war between Vantegramen and [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Wydell\|Wydell]] could serve as an exciting tribulation. Perhaps if she had a certain disciple already running through the warzones to stir up some trouble...
## **Etymology:**
---
>"Katherine" comes from the Greek "katharos", meaning pure, but can also be linked to "hekatere", meaning "each of the two", or even "aikia", meaning torture, alluding to her dark pact. "Avaldi" is meaningless.

## **Backstory:**
---
- Family always antagonizing her for their struggles; constantly scolded her for wasting their resources and making mistakes
- She always fought back and became increasingly aggressive as she got older
- Absolutely couldn't stand [[Characters/PCs/Magdalena Nergüi/Magdalena Nergüi\|Magdalena Nergüi]]'s entitlement because she felt she had everything and yet still asked for more; consequently put her in opposition with [[Characters/PCs/Pelayo Ahogar/Pelayo Ahogar\|Pelayo Ahogar]]
- Still, she appreciated the solace that the [[Factions/The Crab Pact\|The Crab Pact]] gave her, and she grew to care about Lena eventually despite always antagonizing her
- Grew a deep friendship with [[Characters/PCs/Zhyrgal Demasi/Zhyrgal Demasi\|Zhyrgal Demasi]] due to them often being out of the house to escape their bad home lives; Tychia leads Zhyrgal on adventures and they go on play missions of espionage and exploration; cements in Tychia's mind that she wants to be an adventurer
- Still has a residual instinct to insult and antagonize others when she feels threatened
- In naive kid fashion, she listens to the conch shell to know if their friend group will stay intact into adulthood; lives with the curse for most of her life, even as she adventures; staving it off through sheer willpower; rage causes infection to spread faster
- Left family as soon as she was of age; was a bounty hunter for a long time until her [[Magic Items/Ocean's Blight\|Ocean's Blight]] progressed too far for her to continue
- Appreciated Pelayo and their rivalry (who could become a famous bounty hunter first) for not treating her as if she was fragile and dying, but finally decided it was time to kill herself before she was forever petrified by the Ocean's Blight
- Magdalena follows her everywhere; stops Tychia from killing herself, much to Tychia’s dismay
- Realizing Lena wouldn’t let her die, she used [[Magic Items/Runenbijl\|Runenbijl]], which she found on her journeys, to seal Eutro away, pausing the spread of the Ocean's Blight due to Eutro no longer being in the Material Plane, buying her some time; casts the Runenbijl into the [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Frostwell\|Frostwell]]
- Grieves for Pelayo once new of his “death” circulates; Pelayo never truly became famous for his deeds; Tychia feels somber about winning
- Suddenly one day, the Ocean’s Blight begins progressing again; realizes she has to find Eutro and kill him once and for all
- Now chasing [[Characters/PCs/Eutrophios Tengiz/Eutrophios Tengiz\|Eutrophios Tengiz]] to kill him (if she can bring herself to)
## **Etymology:**
---
>"Tychia" comes from the Greek "tyche" (Τύχη), meaning fate. "Merlo" comes from the Latin "merulo", meaning blackbird, which are often bad omens, and "Anahí" comes from the Guarani legend of a woman who was burned at the stake by conquistadors and then turned into a cockspur coral tree.

## **Backstory:**
---
- Prince of [[Factions/Surna-Yele\|Surna-Yele]], part of [[Factions/The Crab Pact\|The Crab Pact]]
- Constantly threatened with abuse if he didn't obey his parents and become the heir they wanted him to be
- Fear of being hurt for mistakes; prone to catastrophizing 
- Raised with constant reminder that he'd inherit the kingdom, the curse, the Surna legacy
- The curse was the [[Magic Items/Ocean's Blight\|Ocean's Blight]] which gave him the cost of prophecy at the cost of potentially his kingdom and anyone else who listens to it
- Told to not associate with the commoners; obeyed until he met Lena and Helle on the beachside; first sense of actual connection
- Had a very lonely childhood; terrified of losing the Crab Pact, so he never told the group about what the Ocean's Blight was out of fear it would drive them away
- Thus, the risk of listening to the prophecy was never properly conveyed, and his secretiveness around the Ocean's Blight only made Tychia see it as a challenge to obtain it and listen to it
- When Tychia is cursed, Eutro's parents lock him in his room and forbid him from leaving; rest of Crab Pact manage to sneak him out by working together; cements in Eutro's mind that he is loved by this group
- When his mother died, the title of Samni (Emperor basically) was passed down to him, and he was responsible for managing the spread of the Ocean's Blight
- Teaming up with [[Characters/Side Characters/Helle Agnes\|Helle Agnes]] and [[Characters/PCs/Zhyrgal Demasi/Zhyrgal Demasi\|Zhyrgal Demasi]], later recruiting [[Characters/PCs/Pelayo Ahogar/Pelayo Ahogar\|Pelayo Ahogar]], [[Characters/PCs/Tychia Merlo-Anahí/Tychia Merlo-Anahí\|Tychia Merlo-Anahí]], and [[Characters/PCs/Magdalena Nergüi/Magdalena Nergüi\|Magdalena Nergüi]] as well (although they had other commitments to mind as well), they scoured the world for any possible way to stop the Ocean's Blight; found nothing
- Knowing that Tychia will soon be overtaken by the Ocean's Blight, he chats with Helle about letting himself be killed. Helle tries to convince him not to and that they still can find a way; eventually she resorts to asserting that anyone trying to kill him will have to kill her first
- He writes the note anyways, knowing full well that Helle would die on this hill; writes the note to his people to kill him at all costs to stop the spread and let him be the final prince cursed with the Ocean's Blight, although Tychia gets to him first
- Is sealed inside the [[Magic Items/Runenbijl\|Runenbijl]] and the [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Frostwell\|Frostwell]] for many years , and the Ocean’s Blight does not spread until [[Characters/PCs/Nkem Abioye/Nkem Abioye\|Nkem Abioye]] accidentally releases him, releasing many years of stored up Ocean’s Blight on the [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Wydell\|Wydell]] castle
- Eutro spends a while running from Tychia, who wants to kill him
- He hears a prophecy that flickers between two states: one where he dies and many others fall with him and one where he doesn't and they are able to salvage what remains of their childhood friend group
- Clinging to the hope that there is some way out of this mess that doesn't involve anyone else dying and that might mend the Crab Pact, he is now is trying not to be killed while deciphering the prophecy 
- Doesn't know how a good ending is even possible with the Crab Pact; he practically killed Helle, after all
- Has a residual instinct to catastrophize when things start going wrong; tunnel visions on the slippery slopes
## **Etymology:**
---
>"Eutrophios" is a portmanteau of the Greek name "Eutropios", meaning "well mannered", and "eutrophication", a phenomenon were nutrient-rich bodies of water become inundated by algae, which consume all of the oxygen and become incapable of supporting life. "Tengiz" means "sea" in Turkic.

## **Backstory:**
---
- After the fall of [[Characters/The Pantheon/Nagaiame\|Nagaiame]], although [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ard'okaal\|Ard'okaal]] absorbed most of his domain, Ard'okaal couldn't absorb the domain of chromatic dragons as she had nothing to do with them
- This left chromatic dragons severely magically weakened
- Mild Dissociation was once a soldier for his village, he was sent on a mission to clear out a dragon's den just to the north
- Despite the evil of chromatic dragons being mostly a holdover of past stereotypes, chromatic dragons were still constantly villainized and villages were keen to capitalize on their newfound weakness
- Killed both the dragon mother and the eggs in the den
- Had been participating in a psychiatry clinic that travelled to his village
- Developed a deep bond with the psychiatrist
- Conversed a lot about the guilt of killing the innocent dragons, witnessing the grief of the mother after the destruction of her eggs
- Village razed by the dragon father, psychiatrist killed during the attack
- Trauma of the situation and seeing his psychiatrist die caused him to develop three split personalities:
	- His old self, albeit more heavily leaning into bugbear stereotypes of idiocy; took what was written on the clipboard as his name, but full list of symptoms was too long, so he shortened it to "Mild Dissociation"
	- His new self, the persona created while interacting with his psychiatrist to pretend his mental health was improving; the persona who was starting to understand the psychiatrist's jargon and learned to self-diagnose, thus dubbing himself "Psychosis"
	- His perception of the psychiatrist himself, all goodness and generosity, intelligent and captivating, dubbed "Eysenck". His way of coping over the real Eysenck's death.
- Now on a journey for revenge, although is this cycle truly what he wants to perpetuate? Can he let go?

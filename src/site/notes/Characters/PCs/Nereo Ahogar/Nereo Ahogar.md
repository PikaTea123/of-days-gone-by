## **Backstory:**
---
>Nereo Ahogar is the grandson of the renowned adventurer, [[Characters/PCs/Pelayo Ahogar/Pelayo Ahogar\|Pelayo Ahogar]], and was raised by Pelayo in the small coastal town of [[Locations/Tharin/Marzol\|Marzol]] for most of his life. During his childhood, Pelayo filled Nereo’s head with tall tales and epics about captains and pirates upon the great open waters, slaying doombeasts and navigating blustering typhoons, and Nereo was utterly entranced. Even as a little boy, Nereo knew he wanted to be captain.
>
>And so he did. Only, Nereo had never been a very patient man, and waiting until well into his adult years to become one of the greats didn’t mesh well with him. Instead, he figured that a few false documents and little white lies couldn’t hurt anybody, and with the renown of his grandfather as the wind behind his sails, he managed to obtain a boat and a captain license. With Pelayo having died 20 years prior, Nereo was all the more determined to follow in his grandfather’s footsteps. And so, he set forth on an expedition.
>
>The first few days of his expedition went remarkably, despite his major lack of experience in navigation and running the crew smoothly. The crew passed the days acting out silly plays with silly masks, and everything was peaceful for a time. However, his inexperience landed them directly in the path of a raging tempest which destroyed their ship and stranded him and his crew on just a few life boats. The days stretched on, the crew starving and weary, and the guilt was rapidly encroaching upon Nereo, so much so that the bird mask he'd been carrying for one of the plays during the ship's sinking never left his face from that point on. This bird mask, however, was actually [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Sjörnur’s Portent\|Sjörnur’s Portent]], an artifact belonging to Pelayo that allows contact with [[Characters/The Pantheon/Sjörnur\|Sjörnur]] himself. On the tenth night of being stuck at sea, Nereo began seeing lights in the water, far in the deep, and soon after, heard Sjörnur’s voice offering him a deal. It was an easy decision; he stood up and walked to the edge of the boat and, much to the horror of his crew, dropped to the sea. Sjörnur would make good on his word, the winds shifting to blow the crew shorebound in what, to them, seemed like a miracle. But in the sea, Nereo sank. Bestowed a grand suit of armour of Sjörnur, he fell deeper and deeper, twisting and contorting as a sharp pain burrowed into him at the base of his spine and his tail was replaced with a Leviathan’s. After clawing his way out of the depths and chaining his tail to his shoulder guard to keep it contained, Nereo now wanders the world, hunting down anyone who dares upset the balance of the world. Through this, he prays that he may atone for his sins.
## **Etymology:**
---
>"Nereo" is the Spanish form of "Nereus", the Greek god of the sea's bounty. "Ahogar" in Spanish translates directly to "to drown".

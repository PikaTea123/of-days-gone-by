## **Backstory:**
---
>Kaioptych 1109, or Kaio for short, was originally an artifact called [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Living Immolation\|Living Immolation]], imbued with ancient druidic fire magic by the Icon of the Inferno, [[Characters/The Pantheon/Kragnyr\|Kragnyr]], himself. After a brief period of tagging along with [[Characters/PCs/Cortège/Cortège\|Cortège]] until his death, when the Living Immolation was placed in a secret vault, he was dug up by [[Characters/PCs/Dr. Will Erneut/Dr. Will Erneut\|Dr. Will Erneut]]. As a commission for the [[Factions/Cult of the Lead Swan\|Cult of the Lead Swan]], Dr. Erneut created Kaio a body to act as a Trojan Horse for the cult, which they planned to place in the nearby city and detonate. However, before he could be brought out into the world, the cult's operation was stopped by [[Characters/PCs/Yuan Jiao/Yuan Jiao\|Yuan Jiao]], who took him in along with [[Characters/PCs/Dara Bakvong/Dara Bakvong\|Dara Bakvong]], one of the few sympathizers within the ranks of the cult. The three quickly became inseparable, and together, created Yuan Jiao’s dream, the [[Locations/Tharin/Anadrie/Ptarmigy/Ptarmigy Inn\|Ptarmigy Inn]].
> 
>During his time in the Ptarmigy Inn, Kaio fell in love with the quirks and oddities of humans, particularly origami and other arts and crafts which he often gave to the other two as presents. In return, Dara would make him flower crowns and Yuan Jiao would polish and take care of him. However, unbeknownst to him, the time bomb planted within him could not be turned off, and on one fateful night, Kaio detonated, burning the inn to the ground and forever immortalizing it in the history books as the [[Locations/Tharin/Anadrie/Ptarmigy/Ptarmigy Inn#The Ptarmigy Inn Tragedy\|Ptarmigy Inn Tragedy]]. Kaio was in the tavern of the inn when the fire began, and while he was able to escape, it badly scorched his frame, and the guilt of having caused so many casualties prompted him to flee. The detonation unlocked his full potential as a creation of Kragnyr, granting him powerful fire magic, but the vessel he was housed in wasn’t made to last permanently, and with every day that passes, it scorches him more and more until the day it will inevitably reduce him to ashes.
> 
>Now Kaio wanders trying to figure out how he can bring back Yuan Jiao and Dara, presuming them dead. Remembering the legends Yuan Jiao told him once upon he time, he began folding paper cranes out of his fire trying to reach a thousand, then two thousand, then ten, and despite the folktale never coming true, he still chases that wish. Even if it scorches his hands in the process and leaves his body coated in ash and soot. While it remains nothing but a pipe dream, it has culminated in the creation of Keztrel, a sentient paper crane made of pure fire which assists Kaio in combat when it arises. 
## **Etymology:**
---
>"Kaio" in Greek is a verb that means "to burn", and "-ptych" is a Greek root meaning "fold". The 1109 is a pun on Japanese number readings. 1-10-9 can be read as "hi-to-ku" (火解く), which roughly translates to "to unbind a fire". However, it can also be read as "hito-juu-ku" or "hi to juuku" (非と重苦), which translates to "error and intense suffering".

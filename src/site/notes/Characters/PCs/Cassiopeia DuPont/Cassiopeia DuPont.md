## **Backstory:**
---
- Her and her twin sister [[Characters/Side Characters/Adalea DuPont\|Adalea DuPont]] were born in [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Nyphit Temple\|Nyphit Temple]] in the forests just beyond [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Wydell\|Wydell]], raised to fill the role of the Sentries, people who are tasked with sealing extraplanar portals if they happen to spontaneously open due to brief fluctuations in magic
- Though they were twins, Cassiopeia naturally grew into a more caretaking and responsible role
- At 23 years old, a rift opened in the forest just east of theirs, which would later be dubbed the [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Frostwell\|Frostwell]]
- Uniquely, this portal would not close through regular means, and with the portal being completely opaque, they decided one of them would have to enter
- Cassiopeia, feeling responsible for her sister, told Adalea to not enter and trust in Cassiopeia's abilities; if she never came out, then Adalea would have to simply guard the portal as best as she could and accept Cassiopeia as MIA
- Unlike most portals, this portal led to a small pocket dimension with nothing in it and an extremely slow passing of time
- The Frostwell could only hold one person at a time, but that person would not be able to escape unless someone else was put in
- When Cassiopeia entered, Whisp was ejected, and Cassiopeia would remain stuck in the Frostwell for 18 years without aging, watching through the one-way portal as Adalea turned 41 without her
- Despite Adalea faithfully following her command, Adalea suddenly became desperate enough to risk forfeiting her life for just a chance at saving her sister
- Upon her entering, Cassiopeia was released, and immediately vowed to find a way to free her sister from the Frostwell
## **Etymology:**
---
> "Cassiopeia" is a reference to the Greek myth of Cassiopeia, where due to her sins, Cassiopeia was chained to a throne for eternity in the constellations. "Dupont" means "from the bridge", symbolizing how the gates she guards are bridges between planes.

## **Backstory:**
---
>Dr. Will Erneut is a professor at [[Locations/Tharin/Anadrie/Bellwood/Bellwood University\|Bellwood University]] and the head of the archaeology department. Well regarded in the scientific community for his archaeological discoveries and his activism for peace and unity between [[Locations/Tharin/Anadrie/Bellwood/Bellwood\|Bellwood]] and the surrounding area, Dr. Erneut is a pioneer in uncovering ancient artifacts and converting their powers into more easily usable forms, often inventing tools or weapons for anyone who commissions him, although the ethics of his commissioners has never really been a priority for him. One of these commissions was for the [[Factions/Cult of the Lead Swan\|Cult of the Lead Swan]], leading to the creation of [[Characters/PCs/Kaioptych 1109/Kaioptych 1109\|Kaioptych 1109]] from the artifact [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Living Immolation\|Living Immolation]], a weapon of mass destruction intended to be used in a terrorist attack on [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Wydell\|Wydell]]. It was during this commission that Dr. Will Erneut created his long-term goal: to collect each of the four artifacts bestowed upon the [[Factions/Order of the Arbour\|Order of the Arbour]] by the [[Characters/The Pantheon/Nagaiame\|Icon of Erosion, Nagaiame]]. 
>
>There was a legend that was whispered in the slums and the shadier taverns, behind the alleys and beneath the docks, that if all four artifacts were brought together, it would grant one wish to whoever achieved the feat, and Dr. Erneut was planning to use it to resurrect his wife. His wife, [[Characters/Side Characters/Ikka Meryls Erneut\|Ikka Meryls Erneut]], had died while giving birth to their daughter [[Characters/PCs/Petla Erneut/Petla Erneut\|Petla Erneut]] when they were both age 25. This left Dr. Erneut as the sole caregiver to Petla. Since he could track the Living Immolation after his successful procurement of it, he quickly set off to find the other three. While Dr. Erneut was able to locate neither [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Sjörnur’s Portent\|Sjörnur’s Portent]] nor the [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Twicebound Echo\|Twicebound Echo]], he was able to locate the [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Dunes of Ksekamt\|Dunes of Ksekamt]], which he stole from [[Characters/Side Characters/Ei Aivan\|Ei Aivan]]’s cabin in the night roughly a year after his first expedition for the Living Immolation. 
>
>Despite his failures to locate half of the artifacts, Dr. Erneut decided to make the most of what he did find: the Dunes of Ksekamt, an ornate hourglass that allows the user to reverse the flow of aging when flipped. However, Dr. Erneut had different intentions for it. With some tinkering of the magics imbued in the artifact, he was able to change the artifact to work on others instead of on solely the user, and it was with this altered Dunes of Ksekamt that he became obsessed with parenting properly, correctly. By reversing Petla's age every time he felt he made a major parenting mistake, he was able to parent her from infancy as many times as he needed to to give her the perfect childhood. Over the course of the next 6 years, Dr. Erneut kept reverting her age before he finally made it to a 10 year long run of success. However, what he didn't realize was that Petla's memories weren't reversed by the artifact, nor her mental state, and the trauma of being constantly forced into a state of helplessness caused her to run away, shattering the Dunes of Ksekamt in the process. Now Dr. Erneut is desperately searching for his daughter, praying that his obsession with propriety hasn't cost him the only thing he had left.

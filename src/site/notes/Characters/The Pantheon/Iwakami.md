## Portfolio:
Iwakami, as the Icon of Remembrance, rules over:
- memory, history, language
- preservation, remembrance
- glory of war, mourning of death, nostalgia

---
## Description:
- hides in a cavern, takes the form of a living cave painting surrounded by a seemingly infinite amount of scrawled paragraphs on the walls, painted in a red ink, detailing every event to have ever occurred since the birth of the gods, constantly updating and shrinking smaller to write in the gaps between the existing text
- most paragraphs written in languages lost to time that will never be recovered
- curses anyone who stumbles upon his extremely well hidden domain with madness to protect the secrets of the universe

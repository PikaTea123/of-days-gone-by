### Portfolio:
Vidatur, as the Icon of the Wilds, rules over:
- the wilderness, forests, the land
- wildlife, fauna and flora
- predation, survival, hunting 
- death of animals
- the moon, moonlight
- dreams, sleep
- psychopomps

---
### Description:
Vidatur takes the form of a large, glowing, spectral deer, standing at approximately 155 ft. tall measured to the shoulder, although they have been known to shrink themselves down to a 20 ft. form when interacting with mortals. They have large antlers with vine cordage tangled between them that sometimes functions as an Aeolian Harp, making sound as wind flows through the strings. Multiple rows of large, serrated fangs line their maw, in which a long blood red tongue is situated, fabled by parents to hunt the woods of Tharin once the moon rises, although Vidatur themself has never been known to hunt mortals, since it doesn't require sustenance. Their eyes are silver and emit moonlight.

## The Lunar Courts
Up on the moon lies lush yet silver-dusted thickets that dot the moon, where they reign, lies the afterlife of all animals where the souls of animals are put to rest, or for those with a grander destiny in mind, are inducted into one of three Lunar Courts: the Shepherd's Court, the Hunter's Court, or the Bellwether's Court. Eight Higher Council members lead the Lunar Courts, although with the recent desertion of [[Characters/Playable Characters/Conan Dubhan & Beo/Conan Dubhan & Beo\|Beo]], the Shepherd Some say they can see the silhouette of a rabbit on the moon, the first ever reaped spirit, and the one who gave up its eternal afterlife to pave the future of afterlife for all. 
### The Shepherd's Court:
>   The Shepherd's Court is responsible for the deliverance of dreams to all, and every court member, no matter the rank, descends each night to grant dreams, although some will descend during the day if a situation so calls. 
### The Hunter's Court:
>   The Hunter's Court is responsible for chasing souls that resist being lifted to the afterlife due to unfinished business, regret, stubbornness, etc. They operate under the idea that no one deserves to be denied an afterlife, regardless of who they were. 
### The Bellwether's Court:
>   The Bellwether's Court is responsible for the guidance of spirits to their respective afterlives. In this universe, there is no heaven and hell. Instead, each god holds an afterlife within their homeplane, receiving different souls depending on what the Bellwether's Court judges them to be deserving of. This court is rather new, as Vidatur only inherited psychopomps into their domain upon the death of [[Characters/The Pantheon/Nagaiame\|Nagaiame]], the original psychopomp Icon.

## Afterlife
Vidatur is the overseer of two afterlives. The first is [[Locations/Planes/Jantikata\|Jantikata]], the afterlife for all animals who do not decide to join the Lunar Courts. It is a seemingly endless mosaic of silver pastures, lush forests, vibrant seas, and other bountiful habitats. It is a utopia for all animals, although people who are very heavily aligned with the wilderness, such as some druids and those who lived entire lives in the wilds, can find themselves in this afterlife as well. The second is [[Locations/Planes/Jagtmarker\|Jagtmarker]], Vidatur's main plane of occupancy, which consists of an eternal forest. Those who are sent here are doomed to an eternity of being hunted by Vidatur only to rematerialize and repeat the cycle, often as a punishment for being malevolently predatory in some way during their life.

## Relationships
While Vidatur is an Icon of Death, they do not like death beyond what is necessary and natural. Thus, they were very close with Nagaiame, who reigned over other natural deaths such as illness and aging. They were also friendly with [[Characters/The Pantheon/Sjörnur\|Sjörnur]] who, having domain over the stars and deep space, was often not too far away from Vidatur's moon reign. However, Vidatur is at ideological odds with and despises [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ard'okaal\|Ard'okaal]], who championed violent death and bloodshed, and [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ksekamt\|Ksekamt]], who is obsessed with immortality and eternal plenty, never wanting to allow anything to die. Along with Nagaiame, Vidatur helped steal the [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Dunes of Ksekamt\|Dunes of Ksekamt]] from Ksekamt, which Nagaiame would later gift to Ei Aivan.

## **Backstory:**
---
>Naochi Avaldi was one of the four founding members of the [[Factions/Order of the Arbour\|Order of the Arbour]], along with [[Characters/Playable Characters/Pelayo Ahogar/Pelayo Ahogar\|Pelayo Ahogar]], [[Characters/Playable Characters/Cortège/Cortège\|Cortège]], and [[Characters/Side Characters/Ei Aivan\|Ei Aivan]], and served as the bruiser of the group. Her adventuring life began as a pay-for-hire mercenary wandering the [[Locations/Tharin/Muejiza/Glassen Slade\|Glassen Slade]] and slaying the monsters that roamed the desert. While she was content with this "comfortable" routine, chasing the exhilaration of nearly dying on the daily and still coming out on top, her life changed when she stumbled upon the other three founding members struggling against a Duskviper and rescued them from the risky situation. After deciding to guide them on their trek through the Glassen Slade, she found herself growing attached to the group's antics, and eventually, they officially decided to found their Order, soon pledging themselves to aid the Icon of Erosion, [[Characters/The Pantheon/Nagaiame\|Nagaiame]].
>
>During her time in the Order of the Arbour, she harboured a crush on [[Characters/Side Characters/Ei Aivan\|Ei Aivan]] that she kept secret out of fear of destroying the group, so she entered a relationship with a random noble they encountered on their journey to try and forget about it and had a child named [[Characters/Side Characters/Selica Avaldi\|Selica Avaldi]], who she left with the father when they split. When the Order made their final deal with Nagaiame to fulfill his dying wish, to trap the Inkscourges within his domain so they would not wreak havoc upon the world, each of the four members were given a special artifact, with Naochi's being the [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Twicebound Echo\|Twicebound Echo]], a mirror that allowed her to perfectly clone of herself, although only two of her could exist at a time.
>
>After this final battle with the Inkscourges, Naochi retired from a life of adventuring, now beginning to feel the burdens of age. One day, Selica arrived at her doorstep and left her own daughter [[Characters/Playable Characters/Katherine Avaldi/Katherine Avaldi\|Katherine Avaldi]] for Naochi to take care of, although Naochi never got to learn the reason why. But still, Naochi would not abandon a child, especially her own grandchild. She took Katherine under her care and, for the first few years, things were fine, but everything would change the day Pelayo was assassinated. In a bout of paranoia, due in part both to the assassination and Cortège's death several years prior in their final battle with the Inkscourges, she locked away all of her money in a secret vault, except for the Twicebound Echo, and moved to the countryside to hide off the grid with Katherine. While they were able to subsist on just their own farming for a while, a drought struck, forcing Naochi to resort to a desperate tactic to get food. She used the Twicebound Echo to create a clone who, being a perfect copy, also knew the plan, and they would fight to the death. Whoever survived would use the other's flesh as food. This went on for long enough that Naochi no longer knows if she is the original or if the original was lost somewhere along the way, but it hardly matters; Katherine has disappeared somewhere in the night, and all she cares about now is getting Katherine home safely, wherever she may have gone. Her muscles may not be as strong as they once were, but all her time spent around death has given her a certain mastery of it, and she isn’t afraid to use it if necessary. Still, if she makes a few stops along the way for posterity's sake, then who could blame her?
## **Etymology:**
---
>"Naochi" is a portmanteau between a homophone of the English "now" and the Chinese "吃" (chī), meaning "to eat". "Avaldi" is meaningless.

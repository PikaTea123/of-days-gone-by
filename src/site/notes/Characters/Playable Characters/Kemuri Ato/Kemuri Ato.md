## **Backstory:**
---
- Born in a small village south of [[Locations/Tharin/Muejiza/Muejiza\|Muejiza]] that held the [[Factions/Vek'nai\|Vek'nai]] people
- As an Aarakocra, she was raised in a culture that heavily encouraged ambition and achieving greatness within their very short 30 year lifespans
- As a teenager, she was known as an prodigy of mechanics, creating many small gadgets, although her most significant one is her flamethrower, which she uses to protect herself in combat
- At the age of 18 (adulthood), she immediately left home to pursue her pyrotechnics, collecting rare plants and materials and trying to use them in fireworks
- Fireworks are a very integral part to the Vek'nai as they're used to symbolize their blazing life force that shines before slowly fizzling out
- She made her way around the continent, performing fireworks displays for the towns she stopped by along the way
- She also flew between her fireworks and danced as part of her shows
- However, after 3 years, she begins to grow resentful of the constant feeling of needing to keep pushing further and further as her time grows more and more limited
- Eventually, she runs into [[Characters/Playable Characters/Azarith/Azarith\|Azarith]] whose appreciation of her craft gives her a small bit of motivation to keep going, but she still wishes to live a more peaceful life and cherish her time more
- Feels like she'll disappoint her parents who died when she was 12 if she folds now
- Doesn't know that her entire home village (those that didn't leave at 18) was massacred by the [[Factions/Cult of the Lead Swan\|Cult of the Lead Swan]]
- Now wandering the world with Azarith to find even rarer materials to potentially use in her fireworks despite her fatigue
- Currently chasing after powdered horn from a rare yellow dragon, using the assumed "evil" of chromatic dragons to justify her hunting of this sapient creature

## **Backstory:**
- Part of [[Factions/The Crab Pact\|The Crab Pact]]
- Told to be constantly cognizant of his conduct to avoid scaring and hurting others
- Large stature and intimidating appearance made others automatically assume the worst of him
- Every mistake he made was scrutinized; not allowed to cry about it
- [[Characters/Playable Characters/Magdalena Nergüi/Magdalena Nergüi\|Magdalena Nergüi]]’s confident and straightforward personality helped him build confidence in who he was, and despite the falsity of their relationship, they quickly became good friends
- Pretended to be in a relationship with Lena once he realized he was gay to avoid being judged for it
- Still has a residual instinct to hurt and punish himself whenever he makes a mistake or hurts others
- Grew a friendly (sometimes not-so-friendly) rivalry with [[Characters/Playable Characters/Tychia Merlo-Anahí/Tychia Merlo-Anahí\|Tychia Merlo-Anahí]], decided to see who could become a renowned bounty hunter faster
- Joined the [[Factions/Order of the Arbour\|Order of the Arbour]] and received [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Sjörnur’s Portent\|Sjörnur’s Portent]] from [[Characters/The Pantheon/Nagaiame\|Nagaiame]]; grew very close to Sjornur (romantic in nature) during their partnership
- Upon Lena's death, he begs [[Characters/The Pantheon/Sjörnur\|Sjörnur]] to revive her; Sjornur uses the elixir he stole from [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ksekamt\|Ksekamt]]; this elixir, the product of millennia worth of research (albeit imperfect), can revive a soul given the soul hasn't decayed too much; due to the odd rules surrounding Ksekamt and Ydarenaia's afterlife, [[Locations/Planes/Limerence\|Limerence]], it works on Lena
- Lena returns, but she is fundamentally changed; Pelayo immediately regrets it
- Upon [[Characters/Playable Characters/Cortège/Cortège\|Cortège]]’s death, he begs the Order of the Arbour not to revive him, knowing what it was like for Lena; they outvote him and he runs away
- Takes in an orphan, names them Nereo, and returns to Marzol
- Is pursued by the [[Factions/Malt and Pearson Co.\|Malt and Pearson Co.]] (secret followers of Ksekamt who learned of Pelayo's resurrecting of Lena) for his means of resurrecting; asks Zhyrgal to help fake his death so no one will ever get closer to learning resurrection, changing his identity, leaving behind Sjornur's Portent, and convincing almost everyone that he's died
- Is later sold out to the Surna by Zhrygal and is pursued by them, and the Malt and Pearson Co. follow the Surna to track Pelayo; no others know of his true identity, however
## **Etymology:**
---
>"Pelayo" is the Spanish derivative of the Greek name "Pelagius", meaning "of the sea", and "Ahogar" directly translates to "to drown" in Spanish.

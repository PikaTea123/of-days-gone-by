## **Backstory:**
---
>Dara Bakvong was born into the [[Factions/Cult of the Lead Swan\|Cult of the Lead Swan]], with both of his parents having been members of the cult for many years. Growing up in the cult, he was often told to rely on the other members of the cult and had his confidence in his ability to do things on his own destroyed, all in the effort to make him more vulnerable and impressionable. He was also trained in the art of Cae Rong, a martial arts style that revolves around shaping your essence into a physical form and controlling it as an extension of oneself. This manifestation is thought to be a representation of one’s values and spirit, which he was instructed to use to aid in the cult’s missions. Not knowing any better, Dara followed orders to the best of his abilities, resulting in his participation in the [[Factions/Vek'nai#Vek’nai Massacre\|Vek’nai Massacre]] which, despite his devotion to the cult, still deeply traumatized him. Dara’s Cae Rong manifestation, his personal essence, had always taken many aspects from the Icon of Ruin, [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ard'okaal\|Ard'okaal]], the object of the cult’s worship, which made many others quite interested in his capabilities, but after his involvement in the massacre and him beginning to question his loyalties, he lost his Cae Rong manifestation. Due to this, he was cast aside and abused once again for his inability to fight.
>
>For the next few years, Dara began to cast his gaze upwards, charting the stars whenever he was allowed to go out on his own. To him, these stars seemed to be magical beacons of wonder, casting the world in a celestial silver. Still, he had orders to complete. His next major operation would be to guard [[Characters/Playable Characters/Kaioptych 1109/Kaioptych 1109\|Kaioptych 1109]] which, as he was told, was simply an experimental protection device. At first, he took this without question—it was much better than all that murdering business—but after seeing that Kaio was a sentient being, he began to sneak into Kaio’s containment chamber to make conversation. Perhaps they weren’t the best of friends, but all they really had was each other, so they took advantage of the company when they could. Eventually, it all came to a head when [[Characters/Playable Characters/Yuan Jiao/Yuan Jiao\|Yuan Jiao]] approached Dara one of his stargazing excursions and made a proposal to him: his freedom in exchange for assistance in stopping the operation. Together, they were able to break out Kaio and, following Yuan Jiao, helped him start the [[Locations/Tharin/Anadrie/Ptarmigy/Ptarmigy Inn\|Ptarmigy Inn]].
>
>During the era of the Ptarmigy Inn, Dara spent the years wandering the world and mapping the stars, which he’d used as a source of guidance in place of the cult members. Yet still, he kept coming back to the inn week after week to spend time with the others. Eventually, despite his love for the stars, Dara found himself leaving the inn less and less in order to be closer to Yuan Jiao, deciding that he was content with just watching the stars from the roof of the inn. This worsened to the point that he lived entirely for Yuan Jiao, even if Yuan Jiao didn’t know it. Everything was well for a while, but it would all change during the [[Locations/Tharin/Anadrie/Ptarmigy/Ptarmigy Inn#The Ptarmigy Inn Tragedy\|Ptarmigy Inn Tragedy]], where Dara was in the basement of the Ptarmigy Inn when it burnt down. Although he was able to escape without any major injuries, the carbon monoxide poisoning gave him amnesia, unable to remember the cult, Kaio, or Yuan Jiao. Now he wanders, trying desperately to piece together the life he once lived from the little information he has. Mainly, his Cae Rong manifestation has returned in an entirely new form, shaped into spectral arms that resemble Yuan Jiao’s. Perhaps if the smoke hadn’t weakened his vision, he’d be able to see all the puzzle pieces that hang around him. Or maybe this is just what he needs to let go and restart anew.
## **Etymology:**
---

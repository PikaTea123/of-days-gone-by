## **Backstory:**
---
- Born on an asteroid, travelled through space for millennia
- Shown eldritch horrors by [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ryst\|Ryst]] so Ryst could stave off his own loneliness; Iden was too young and dumb to comprehend it anyways
- Eventually gained consciousness 
- Came to Tharin and created the [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Frostwell\|Frostwell]] on impact
- Learned about the world, now trying to comprehend the eldritch horrors as if they were simply another thing to learn about
- Feels so small in this world she knows so little about
- Feels she can't get through the day on her own, changes personality/mask to a caricature to surpass challenges
- Has a bunch of wildly anachronistic outfits that she switches between on a dime (cowboy, pirate, knight, ninja, etc.)
## **Etymology:**
---
>When paired with her nickname "Titi", "Iden 'Titi' Chrysos" becomes a play on words of "identity crisis".

## **Backstory:**
- Part of [[Factions/The Crab Pact\|The Crab Pact]]; brought the whole group together
- Came from a rich family who never punished her for anything; continued to give into her demands to avoid having to parent her
- People pulled away from her because of her entitled attitude, and her loneliness spurred spite against the world
- The Crab Pact was the one group who cared enough to give her a reality check
- Felt inadequate as she was never taught how to actually live; [[Characters/Playable Characters/Pelayo Ahogar/Pelayo Ahogar\|Pelayo Ahogar]] was the patient friend who guided her whenever she needed help and acted as her anchor, knowing how it felt to be judged for your gaps of knowledge
- Stole money from her parents to furnish the group's secret seaside cave base, and later to help Tychia run away from home
- When they found out, Lena was disowned practically on the spot; Eutro, Helle, and Zhyrgal took turns bringing her food as Lena was forced to squat in their hideout
- As a sort of "soft payment", she learns to brew potions from materials she can gather from nature to help her friends in everyday life
- Struggled a lot with not having everything at her disposal; with being powerless; still has a residual instinct to override the autonomy of others' decision-making if she feels she knows better
- Devoted her life to finding a way to break the [[Magic Items/Ocean's Blight\|Ocean's Blight]] on [[Characters/Playable Characters/Tychia Merlo-Anahí/Tychia Merlo-Anahí\|Tychia Merlo-Anahí]]; prayed often to [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ydarenaia\|Ydarenaia]] to help her healing studies; died in a tragic laboratory accident that killed many people, including [[Characters/Playable Characters/Zhyrgal Demasi/Zhyrgal Demasi\|Zhyrgal Demasi]]’s parents
- Lena managed to return through Pelayo asking [[Characters/The Pantheon/Sjörnur\|Sjörnur]] for a favour through [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Sjörnur’s Portent\|Sjörnur’s Portent]], but this caused parts of her soul to be mismatched and fused with other souls on their return, making her seem absolutely insane as multiple voices talk in her head
- Now knows the horrors of what awaits Tychia if she dies to the Ocean's Blight (a curse created by Ksekamt with a bit of [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ryst\|Ryst]]'s power, meaning it will send her to Ksekamt's death realm); now absolutely determined to not allow Tychia to die, even as Tychia begs to be killed before she becomes a consciousness locked eternally in coral
## **Etymology:**
---
>"Magdalena" is a variation of "Magdalene", referencing Mary Magdalene who, in the New Testament, witnessed Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, and "Nergüi" means "no name" in Mongolian.

## **Backstory:**
---
- [[Factions/Order of the Arbour\|Order of the Arbour]] worked with Nagaiame to help prevent the Inkscourges from escaping his cave
- Each is given an artifact as payment before the final battle
- 1st is [[Characters/Playable Characters/Naochi Avaldi/Naochi Avaldi\|Naochi Avaldi]], who gets the Twicebound Echo, the cloning artifact
- 2nd is [[Characters/Side Characters/Ei Aivan\|Ei Aivan]], who gets the Dunes of Ksekamt, the age reversal artifact to restore her to her prime
- 3rd is [[Characters/Playable Characters/Pelayo Ahogar/Pelayo Ahogar\|Pelayo Ahogar]], who gets Sjörnur's Portent, the blessing of and the ability to commune with Sjörnur
- 4th is the one we now know as Cortège, given [[Magic Items/Nagaiame’s Gifts/Living Immolation\|Living Immolation]], a destructive fire force who he grew quite attached to
- Cortège died in this final battle despite their success in holding back the Inkscourges
- Cortège, right before his death, told Living Immolation to escape and live its own life, emphasizing the value of freedom and autonomy
- Rest of group begged [[Characters/The Pantheon/Nagaiame\|Nagaiame]] to resurrect Cortège
- Nagaiame, knowing he was already going to die due to [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ard'okaal\|Ard'okaal]] taking the majority of his followers, gives up his scales to create a form to hold Cortège's soul, although Cortège loses memory of his death and his original name
- Since Nagaiame had to unbind Cortège's soul from both his memories of death and his name to avoid Cortège's soul being disintegrated due to the rule-breaking, and if he ever learns either, then he will disappear again
- He's given the pseudonym Cortège so he never learns of his old name
- Eventually, he realizes he doesn't age anymore and can't die due to Nagaiame's gifted form
- While he made it very clear he doesn't want to be immortal, the others didn't want him to die again, so they kept him in the dark
- He kept on pushing, but they can't tell him, and the group breaks apart
- He desperately wants to die to see Ei and Pelayo along with his family again in the afterlife 
## **Etymology:**
---
>Cortège comes from the English word of the same name, which means a solemn procession, often referring to a funeral procession, alluding to the nature of his scale swarm and his themes of grieving over the living.

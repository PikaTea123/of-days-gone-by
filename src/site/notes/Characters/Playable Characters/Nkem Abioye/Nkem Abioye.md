---
- An ambassador for [[Locations/Tharin/Vantegramen\|Vantegramen]]; aunt is Ifunanya, a knight and operating as a bodyguard for the mission
- Wydell never received the notice of an ambassador coming, causing the guards of [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Wydell\|Wydell]] to attack Nkem as if she was an invader
- Ifunanya stepped forth to protect her while Nkem hides, Ifunanya gets injured while fighting off the guards
- Just before Ifunanya is killed, Nkem runs in with [[Magic Items/Runenbijl\|Runenbijl]], seals Ifunanya inside to save her
- Ends up releasing the ancient evil that was sealed inside, unleasing chaos upon the castle
- Spent the last seven years trying to figure out how to free her aunt and almost gave up, but a new lead on the creator of the axe has sent her back out to find an answer
- Ifunanya is now trapped as the carvings on the axe head; "speaks" to Nkem by shifting as the carvings to form pictograms
- Nkem feels both responsible for Ifunanya and also feels she has to reseal away the evil
## **Etymology:**
---
>"Nkem" is short for "Nkemdilim" which means "that which is mine belongs to me" in Igbo. "Abioye" means "born into royalty" in Yoruba. "Ifunanya" translates to "love", but also to "to see in one's eye" as she can only communicate by being seen.

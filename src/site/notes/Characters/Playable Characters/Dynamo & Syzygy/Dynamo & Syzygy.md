## **Backstory:**
---
- Dynamo (an actual cat and game-mechanic wise, the artificer):
	- created as an experiment by Dr. Will Erneut as a gift for Petla
	- Will felt that an non-sapient animal had the potential to be dangerous to Petla, so he used one of the artifacts he'd collected to breathe consciousness into the cat
	- during his time there, Petla kept her distance in fear that Will would do something bad to the cat if she got too close to the cat
	- after Petla's escape and Will's departure in pursuit of her, the cat was left alone and begun studying Will's notes to pass the time
	- learned to exist quietly in the house and avoided drawing attention to himself
	- having observed Will for a long time, he quickly grew competent at tinkering and experimented on many of the abandoned works that Will left behind
	- named himself Dynamo after seeing Will's research papers on the dynamo effect
	- one of these inventions was a robotic dog left unfinished by Ikka Meryls Erneut
	- Dynamo fixed him up and called him Syzygy
- Syzygy (a robotic dog and game-mechanic wise, the steel defender):
	- created by Ikka Meryls Erneut (whose genius rivalled and in some fields surpassed Will's), intended to protect Petla and be her faithful companion
	- was not finished before Ikka Meryls' death
	- originally a non-sapient robot dog when Dynamo fixed him
	- although he had Syzygy, Dynamo grew depressed about having no one who truly knew him, no one to talk to or to hold him over through the rough times
	- Dynamo eventually had a breakdown over just how lonely he was and, continuing off the notes left behind by Will, programmed a near perfect simulated consciousness into Syzygy
	- Syzygy was programmed to be just like a real person; even if Syzygy wasn't real and would eventually fall into disrepair past a point Dynamo could fix, Dynamo wanted to experience such affection at least once, no matter how fleeting
	- Syzygy, knowing this and wanting to help, decided to suggest to Dynamo that they should leave and experience life beyond the walls of Will's laboratory
	- Syzygy's real goal, which he wants to be a surprise, is to track down either Vidatur or Ksekamt and ask them to transform him into a real blood and flesh dog
- They are romantically involved with each other
- Dynamo is has to maintain Syzygy to keep him running
- Syzygy is the one stabilizing force in Dynamo's life
- Dynamo has spent so much time perfecting Syzygy's artificial intelligence that he's failed to realize he doesn't truly care if its not technically "real"; the emotions Syzygy feels and the thoughts he thinks are real, and for all intents and purposes, he'd be okay with that if he just took a step back
- Syzygy has spent so much of his life assuming that his artificial creation somehow makes him lesser and fails to see the intrinsic value he has
- Dynamo is so focused on living in what he views as a fleeting moment that he fails to realize this will last a long while and that ignoring the future will only hurt the future they could have
- Syzygy is so focused on what could be that he fails to see that they could be happy as they are now
- Still, they genuinely want what is best for each other and have each other's back through thick and thin
## **Etymology:**
---
> "Dynamo" is a reference to the Dynamo Effect, the principle which is believed to be the origin of the Earth's magnetic field. "Syzygy" is an English word meaning "the alignment of three or more celestial bodies".

## **Backstory:**
---
>Conan grew up in the small town of [[Locations/Tharin/Anadrie/Ptarmigy/Ptarmigy\|Ptarmigy]], raised only by his mother after his father's passing in the [[Locations/Tharin/Anadrie/Ptarmigy/Ptarmigy Inn#The Ptarmigy Inn Tragedy\|Ptarmigy Inn Tragedy]] soon after his birth. This tragedy pushed his mother to abuse him and neglect him, often beating him in a drunken daze to cope with the loss and forgetting to feed him. This all came to a head one night when he met Beo. Beo is a Draumr, a dream spirit created by the Icon of the Wilds, [[Characters/The Pantheon/Vidatur\|Vidatur]], to venture down to Tharin every night and bestow dreams upon the people. As a member of the [[Characters/The Pantheon/Vidatur#The Shepherd's Court\|Shepherd’s Court]], Beo was a major voice in the Higher Council and was gifted with far greater powers than most of his kin. However, even the most powerful of Draumr must follow certain rules. First, they must not interfere with the lives of mortals. And second, everyone must wake eventually.
>
>Beo had been in charge of Conan’s dreams for a few months when Conan’s mother died of alcohol poisoning. While he had grown rather attached to the child already, it was at this moment that he decided to take Conan under his care, knowing Conan would not survive if there was no intervention. That night, he bestowed unto Conan a dream. Normally, if one stays in a dream for too long, whether it be because of the Draumr getting too attached or the dreamer not wanting to wake up, it will naturally corrupt into a nightmare and force the dreamer back awake. However, Conan’s fear of the waking world was much stronger than his fear of any nightmare, and with Beo helping to guide Conan by manipulating the dream world to direct Conan’s movements, Beo was able to help Conan escape from the house. Only, there was one problem; he had broken the laws of the Draumr. 
>
>For breaking divine law, Beo was dragged into the Shepherd's Court only a few hours after making his escape, now on the other end of Vidatur's gavel. But Beo was no fool. He knew from the moment he came down to see Conan that he'd need an escape plan. So there he was, standing in the middle of the courtroom, Vidatur looming over him and ready to cast his judgement. And then suddenly, Beo was gone. Teleported. Gone to somewhere in the world that was hidden enough that Vidatur would take some time finding him. And in that alley in [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Wydell\|Wydell]] where he had teleported, he met up with a sleeping Conan who he had left there before pretending to get accidentally caught. For the next two years, they spent almost every waking hour on the run, venturing through city and forest alike to hide from their pursuers, with Beo having to speak through Conan to avoid having his voice be tracked down. Conan even grew into his old baby blanket, now wearing it over his head as a sort of cowl. His superior powers allow him to hide from Vidatur and the other Draumr, but forever being on the run is no life for a child, and he is not fool enough to think he won’t be caught eventually. Something must change, lest Beo’s luck finally runs out and he be tried for his crimes against the gods.
## **Etymology:**
---
> "Conan" and "Dubhan" come from Gaelic, meaning "little wolf" and "little dark one" respectively. "Beo" is a reference to "Beowulf", mainly as a pun on the fact that he is a wolf.

## **Backstory:**
---
>While Whisp does not know his birth parents, he was discovered trapped in the [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Frostwell\|Frostwell]] as a baby, cast into the portal as a sacrifice from the [[Factions/Cult of the Lead Swan\|Cult of the Lead Swan]] to [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ard'okaal\|Ard'okaal]]. Once rescued, he was brought to the [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Nyphit Temple\|Nyphit Temple]] nestled in the mountains to the north, but as they were unable to take care of him well, they made a deal with a group of traders to take him in. So, Whisp was adopted by [[Characters/Playable Characters/Ixila & Basset/Ixila & Basset\|Ixila]], a lizardfolk candle maker who taught him the significance of candles. The lighting of a candle atop a grave aided in guiding the dead to the afterlife. Candlesticks and candelabras, likewise, were used as a symbol of social standing and glory for the recently deceased, with their complexity symbolizing the status of the dead one. Candelabras in particular were usually reserved for heroes, kings, and others of high regard and fame. 
>
>Originally, Whisp's job was to travel around the war zones between [[Locations/Tharin/Vantegramen\|Vantegramen]] and [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Wydell\|Wydell]] in the night to light the graves of the war casualties. Whether they were civilian deaths or soldier deaths, it was often too dangerous for their families to give them a proper send off, and so Whisp, with Ixila's guidance, took it upon himself to grant peace to these people. It was in one of these war zones that Whisp’s wings were burned past the point of saving.
>
>Eventually, Ixila decided that Whisp should go adventuring past the borders of the war zone. She provided him with a personalized, ornate, golden candelabra for when he died, and Whisp, feeling entirely undeserving of such a grandiose candelabra, set out on a journey to find a death worthy of the object. Surrounded by death his whole life, he failed to see beyond how people were defined by what they are in death. With lyre and shortsword in hand, Whisp now ventures around the nation to find unlit graves and light them. Sometimes, it is those of families too far from civilization to get them, those in warzones or in perilous situations, or those without anyone in their lives left to grant them a candle. By lighting them a candle, he can grant them solace and allow them to pass into the afterlife peacefully. During these expeditions, Whisp also collects the tales of the dead from those that were still around to remember them. By writing them down, he feels that he can forever immortalize the memories of the deceased. One day, he hopes to replicate one of these deaths, whichever is the most deserving of the candelabra his master bestowed unto him.

## **Etymology:**

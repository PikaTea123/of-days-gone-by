## **Backstory:**
---
- Yellow dragon, a very rare species
- [[Characters/The Pantheon/Nagaiame\|Nagaiame]] was trying to clean the tarnished name of chromatic dragons by telling his followers to uphold the cycle of natural death and not kill sentient life before their time unless absolutely necessary
- Haskadar made an oath to Nagaiame to follow that rule
- Suddenly, Nagaiame dies and his magic is taken away, along with Nagaiame's gifted magic from the oath
- One day, on his turn to go out hunting, his den is razed by [[Characters/Playable Characters/Mild Dissociation/Mild Dissociation\|Mild Dissociation]] and his mate and unborn eggs are killed
- In a rage, he heads down to Mild Dissociation's village and burns it to the ground
- For a long while, he falls into a depressive gloom of simply trying to exist and rarely leaves the particular river bank he decided to stay by, watching his reflection in the river
- Eventually tries to drown himself in the river in guilt, both for being the only survivor and for killing so many in his raze of the town
- [[Characters/The Pantheon/Scaenatio\|Scaenatio]] secretly decides to punish him for breaking his oath before he dies
- Transforms him into a dragonborn and directs him to [[Characters/Playable Characters/Kemuri Ato/Kemuri Ato\|Kemuri Ato]] and [[Characters/Playable Characters/Azarith/Azarith\|Azarith]] to travel alongside them
- Haskadar, under the impression that it was the ghost of Nagaiame giving him one final chance at redemption, decides to continue his oath despite Nagaiame no longer living
- The power of his oath is so strong that it is able to power itself
- He takes it upon himself to guide the two young travellers and impart them his wisdom while trying to find a way to return to his true form
- He hopes to turn back, lead Kemuri and Azarith to his den, and let them kill him and inherit his treasures of magical artifacts and scrolls to fulfill their wishes
- Then, he believes he can join Nagaiame in the afterlife and finally be at peace

## **Etymology:**
---
> "Haskadar" is a portmanteau of the Old Norse "Haskr" (hǫskr) meaning "faded" and the Hebrew "kadar" (קָדַר) meaning "to mourn" or "to darken".

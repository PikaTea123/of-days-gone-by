#Character #TheCrabPact 

- Family always needed to portray an image of perfection and happiness; forced to ignore all problems that pervaded their family
- Even as they became impoverished due to her father being laid off, she was not allowed to tell anyone
- [[Factions/The Crab Pact\|The Crab Pact]] was who she went to to escape all of the problems in her life; constantly acted as a mediator for the group
- Grew very close with [[Characters/PCs/Zhyrgal Demasi/Zhyrgal Demasi\|Zhyrgal Demasi]] who, as a telepath, was able to see through Helle's deception, and even though Zhyrgal wasn't great at comforting Helle, it was the first time Helle felt truly seen; was the one who taught Zhyrgal how to weave, as Helle had to make all her clothing herself
- Eventually, she was forced to enlist in the [[Locations/Tharin/Vantegramen\|Vantegramen]] army to get money she could send back to her family
- Through hard work (mainly to get more money for her family), she rose through the ranks and eventually became a minor celebrity as a commander
- Got PTSD from the war, but tried desperately to hide that anything was wrong
- Often visited various "adventurer's festivals" where she would try to motivate the future generations of adventurers; inspired [[Characters/PCs/Suk-yeong Mun/Suk-yeong Mun\|Suk-yeong Mun]] at one of them
- Found friendship in the supply manager of the Vantegramen army
- Still has a residual instinct to hide her struggles and sacrifice herself to help others
- Followed Tychia when she sealed Eutro inside the [[Magic Items/Runenbijl\|Runenbijl]], and after convincing the [[Factions/Cult of the Lead Swan\|Cult of the Lead Swan]] to cast a sacrifice ([[Characters/PCs/Whisp/Whisp\|Whisp]]) into the [[Locations/Tharin/Wydell/Frostwell\|Frostwell]] to "further their goals" (which she would feel horrible about doing later), she's able to retrieve Runenbijl
- The [[Factions/Surna-Yele\|Surna-Yele]] find out that Helle has their leader and, having discovered the note, chase after Helle to get the axe to destroy it, which Helle absolutely does not want to happen
- She manages to beat them the first time they ambush her, but she doesn't want to hurt the people of her friend, so she lets them go; they kill her during the next ambush
- Having known that she very well might die, Helle handed the axe off to Zhyrgal to keep safe.

[[Characters/The Pantheon/Ksekamt\|Ksekamt]] and [[Characters/The Pantheon/Ydarenaia\|Ydarenaia]] are teaming up
	- Ydarenaia doesn't care all too much about death, but it gets in the way of complete euphoric harmony
		- Her afterlife is a giant wall of amalgamating consciousnesses, all blending into one another and breathing as one individual mass
		- Ksekamt also sends her souls here to keep their souls from decaying through them sharing their energy, so if she can one day recreate her true resurrection on a mass scale, she can bring them all back
